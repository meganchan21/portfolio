        <h1>collaborEAT Mobile App Design Process</h1>

        <h2>Passion Project | September 2021</h2>

             <p>In September of 2021, I began building collaborEAT, an app that connects students with one another so they can improve their cooking skills together.
        
            This app is inspired by my graduate school housemates who improved my cooking skills immensely simply by sharing their recipes, feeding me home-cooked meals, and expecting me to return the favor.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Problem</p>

            <p>College students who enjoy food and are interested in cooking do not know how to improve their food agency, and therefore resort to instant meals and eating out. </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Solution: collaborEAT</p>

            <p>A food-centered community where students can connect, share food, and cook with other people in their area. My goal is to create a tool to help college students improve their food agencies by providing them with a food-centric community that promotes learning and collaboration.</p>
