    <h2>Right-to-Know Chemical Reporting System Design<h2>

        <h2>University of Michigan Partnership Project | September 2021</h2>

            <p2>Project Overview</p2>
            <p3>The Right-to-Know chemical reporting form allows businesses to provide the Fire Department with information about hazardous chemicals at their locations. Filling out the Right-to-Know form on a regular basis ensures the safety of Ferndale community members in the event of a fire emergency. Providing quick and easy access to the specific chemicals on-site will minimize fire damage and keep the community safe.</p3>

            <p2>Problem</p2>
            <p3>The current Right-to-Know hazardous chemical reporting process is outdated. The Fire Department visits each Ferndale business in person to request a paper submission of the form, making the chemical information difficult to collect.</p3>

            <p2>Solution</p2>
            <p3>Educate Ferndale businesses on the importance of Right-to-Know reporting and make it easier for businesses to submit their hazardous chemical information. Redesign the pre-existing form as a digital form with educational elements. Identify opportune times for the Fire Department to spread awareness. Leverage the talents and abilities of the Communications Department to spread awareness. Create an informative flyer with a QR code linking to the online form</p3>

            <p2>My Role</p2>
            <p3>Our team was very collaborative, so each teammate played a part in the design, research, analysis, and project management aspects of the project. I took the lead on user research and was responsible for managing interview, analysis, and testing efforts.</p3>
