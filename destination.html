    <h1>UX Festival Slo Hackathon</h1>
    <h2>Mobile App Design Process<h2>
    <h2>Hackathon Finalist | April 2021</h2>

            <p3>UX Festival selected 200 undergraduate students from around the United States to participate in a one-week-long competition.</p3>

            <p2>The Challenge</p2>
            <p3>Create a mobile or web application that solves the problems of a post-COVID world. Over the course of one week, I worked in a team of 3 to develop user personas, conduct research, ideate, and create an interactive prototype to present to a panel of judges. </p3>

            <p2>My Role</p2>
            <p3>I took on the roles of lead designer and communicator. As the designer, I facilitated brainstorming sessions, ideation sessions, and organized the creation of our prototype. As the communicator, I presented our finished product to a panel of six judges and answered questions during a Q&A session.</p3>
