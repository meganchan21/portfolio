    <h1>Hello, My name is Megan Chan.</h1>
        <p>Everything related to inclusive design, multimodal interaction, and personalized experiences excites me. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and do good.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>My name is Megan and I am an MS Information student focusing on Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>After interning in the technology industry for the past four years, I found a deep appreciation for technological designs that are usable, accessible, and impactful. I always welcome new opportunities to learn and grow, so feel free to contact me if you have any interesting projects or ideas.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy reading, knitting, and making pottery. Music is also a big part of my life and in my free time, I play around with the piano, guitar, and violin.</p>
